# Data Curator

As a **Data Curator**, you play a vital role in assembling and organizing datasets. With `packageR`, you can efficiently curate data by referencing external files (objects stored in cloud storage like S3, GCS, etc.) and arranging them into meaningful folder hierarchies within a Git-Repository. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to leverage `packageR` for your curation tasks:
