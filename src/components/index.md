# Components

The **packageR** UI is designed to streamline the creation of data packages and facilitate efficient data sharing. Connected object storage is displayed in a folder-like structure, allowing users to browse and reference items easily through copy-like operations. Data can also be seamlessly shared for dedicated audience via simple button click.

The **packageR** API complements the UI by enabling API-only access, such as generating presigned URLs or automating the package curation process.
