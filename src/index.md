# Manage Data at Scale

## Overcoming Common Challenges

In today’s digital landscape, data is one of your most powerful assets. However, creating, managing, and distributing data products at scale presents constant challenges. From complex storage needs to coordinating data flow across various clouds, keeping a clear, organized view of your data journey can be overwhelming.

### Are These Common Problems Holding You Back?

#### 1. Massive Data Volumes Sitting in Storage

You've invested time and effort into generating valuable data products, yet they’re often left sitting in storage environments. The challenge: how can you efficiently **package and deliver relevant data to your customers** without unnecessary steps, delays, or duplications on additional servers? Making stored data accessible, useful, and ready to deploy is critical to unlocking its full potential.

#### 2. Data Distributed Across Multiple Clouds

Today, data lives in many places—across various clouds and data centers. To be effective, you need a **clear view of where each data product resides** and a seamless way to access and deliver it. However, every storage layer has its own tooling and processes, making it difficult to track, package, and distribute data efficiently. 

#### 3. Security and Access Management Across Environments

Managing secure access across multi-cloud environments is crucial, but it's a complex task. In some cases, you may want to distribute a simple, private URL, while in others, you need to grant explicit access to specific users or teams. Yet relying on each cloud provider’s proprietary IAM (Identity and Access Management) tools limits flexibility and makes centralized access tracking difficult. **How can you manage access effectively across varied environments** without being restricted by individual cloud IAM systems?

#### 4. Evolving Data Products to Stay Competitive

Data isn't static. As your data products evolve and improve, it’s important to **track which customers received which versions** to provide timely support and targeted solutions. For your team, this also means ensuring they can efficiently experiment, improve, and stage data products without disrupting published versions. The challenge lies in making only the necessary data available without duplicating entire datasets.
